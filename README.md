Functionality extensions:

Logic: 1. Up to 4 players can play the game. 2. Multiple human players
can play the game (this has to be set in the code). 3. Text is sized
depending on the dimensions of the grid displayed.

User interface: 1. Before a game is played, the user is presented with a
screen that allows them to 2. set the grid size, up to 6 by 6 squares.
Any larger would make it difficult to touch an individual line.
